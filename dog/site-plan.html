        Having a well-behaved dog only comes from having a well-trained owner. This concept is something we teach people on their first day of lessons, and here’s the example we like to use: 

        For your birthday, someone gives you a new car. They excitedly tell you the car has seat warmers, 4-wheel drive, and various stereo functions. What a wonderful gift! But there is a slight problem, you don’t know how to drive. You don’t even know how to start this car.
        
        Your dog is like that car, it is capable of so much. Man’s best friend can learn hundreds of words and can develop an intelligence up to a 2-year-old. If you send your dog off to a training school, they will learn but you won’t know how apply their knowledge. That’s why we would rather have the owner present than the dog. With these online lessons, you will better understand your pet and how to align their actions to your desires. You already have the metaphorical car, and we’re going to teach you how to drive.

      <h3>What You Need</h3>
      <p>
        What you need to be successful

        In order for any of these lessons to work, you need certain things:
        Time carved out for training
        If you expect to spend 2 minutes with your dog and see results, you would be wrong. Having a dog is a major commitment, so making time each day for training should be understood. We recommend 15 minutes per session, but if you can only do 5 minutes that is fine if you do it consistently.
        Some sort of reward
        We have found over the years that smelly, soft meat treats work the best. It catches most dogs’ attentions, but not always. Learn what your dog likes most. Some dogs would prefer getting their toy as a reward, other’s only want lots of praise from their owner. 
        A positive attitude
        If you go into your training session expecting it to be bad, it will be. Dogs pick up on humans’ emotions, so if you are negative your dog knows it. We all have bad days, and if you find yourself having one, just spend a couple minutes working on commands your dog has already mastered. It will keep that time consistency while also making the session a success.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        My friends have well-behaved dogs but they didn’t really train them. Why do I have to train mine?

        Just like people, dogs have personalities! Some pick things up quickly, others really want to please their owners and so on. With dogs like this, sometimes the training is accidental, it’s just a pattern the pooch picked up. While this is convenient, will your friend be able to replicate that with their next dog? Training is not just for our canine friends, it’s also for the owner. Here at Happy Tails, we want every dog to have a chance at being well-behaved.
        
        What kind of training do you use?
        
        Here at Happy Tails, we want dogs to be, well, happy! To do that we apply positive reinforcement. We believe in using lots of rewards and praise. There are times we understand the need to use correction tones/actions (such as a quick, sharp sound) to stop a behavior, but that why we show how to use them properly and teach always to immediately follow up with a reward. A happy dog is an easily trainable dog.
        
        Can a dog really be trained over a computer?
        
        No, but you can. It is our goal for you to understand what to do to train your dog and why you do it the way you do. If we are successful, you should be able to apply these lessons over and over again without physically meeting a dog trainer. We do acknowledge that in certain situations it is necessary to take your dog one, and we support that, but that is the exception rather than the rule.
