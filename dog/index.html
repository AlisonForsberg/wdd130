            Having a well-behaved dog only comes from having a well-trained owner. This concept is something we teach people on their first day of lessons, and here’s the example we like to use: 
        </p>
        <p>
            For your birthday, someone gives you a new car. They excitedly tell you the car has seat warmers, 4-wheel drive, and various stereo functions. What a wonderful gift! But there is a slight problem, you don’t know how to drive. You don’t even know how to start this car.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Your dog is like that car, it is capable of so much. Man’s best friend can learn hundreds of words and can develop an intelligence up to a 2-year-old. If you send your dog off to a training school, they will learn but you won’t know how apply their knowledge. That’s why we would rather have the owner present than the dog. With these online lessons, you will better understand your pet and how to align their actions to your desires. You already have the metaphorical car, and we’re going to teach you how to drive.
