        <h4>
        Question: My friends have well-behaved dogs but they didn’t really train them. Why do I have to train mine?
        </h4>
        <p>
        Answer: Just like people, dogs have personalities! Some pick things up quickly, others really want to please their owners and so on. With dogs like this, sometimes the training is accidental, it’s just a pattern the pooch picked up. While this is convenient, will your friend be able to replicate that with their next dog? Training is not just for our canine friends, it’s also for the owner. Here at Happy Tails, we want every dog to have a chance at being well-behaved.

        <h4>
        Question: What kind of training do you use?
        </h4>
        <p>
        Answer: Here at Happy Tails, we want dogs to be, well, happy! To do that we apply positive reinforcement. We believe in using lots of rewards and praise. There are times we understand the need to use correction tones/actions (such as a quick, sharp sound) to stop a behavior, but that why we show how to use them properly and teach always to immediately follow up with a reward. A happy dog is an easily trainable dog.

        <h4>
        Question: Can a dog really be trained over a computer?
        </h4>
        <p>
        Answer: No, but you can. It is our goal for you to understand what to do to train your dog and why you do it the way you do. If we are successful, you should be able to apply these lessons over and over again without physically meeting a dog trainer. We do acknowledge that in certain situations it is necessary to take your dog one, and we support that, but that is the exception rather than the rule.
